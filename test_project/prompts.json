    "A dramatic hero shot of a steaming espresso in a white ceramic cup on a marble countertop. Morning light streams through a window creating soft shadows. The espresso has a perfect golden crema. Modern minimalist kitchen in the background, slightly blurred. Professional food photography style, warm color palette with rich browns and cream tones.",
    "An overhead flat-lay of a pour-over coffee setup: a glass Chemex brewer with light brown coffee inside, whole coffee beans scattered artistically, a gooseneck kettle, and a small digital scale. White marble surface. Clean, bright lighting. Same warm color palette as slide 1 - rich browns, cream, and white tones. Professional product photography."

    "Camera pulls back smoothly from the espresso cup, the scene gently crossfades as the view rises upward, transitioning to an overhead perspective looking down at the pour-over setup."
