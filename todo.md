chat renders markdown

Adjust prompts to make sure all questions asked are multiple choice with the recommended default as choice a

refactor so all prompts are in a single, well documented yaml file; use ruaml (sp?) to preserve comments

The chat says "**Shall I generate the prompt descriptions to create these images in Midjourney/DALL-E, or do you need help writing the script/speaker notes for these two slides?**" which means it doesn't understand its job

add an AGENTS.md that says "Use uv" and "Test all changes e2e with the command line" and "don't use emoji"
